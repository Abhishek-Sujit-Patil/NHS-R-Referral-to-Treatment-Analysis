NHS RTT Delay Analysis

This project analyses NHS Referral to Treatment (RTT) waiting times (Apr 2024â€“Feb 2025) across acute trusts, computing backlog and breach metrics (>18 and >52 weeks) and segmenting trusts using hierarchical clustering (Euclidean distance, complete linkage), alongside a volume-delay typology to interpret operational differences. Full findings and visuals are in the interactive Rmd report.
